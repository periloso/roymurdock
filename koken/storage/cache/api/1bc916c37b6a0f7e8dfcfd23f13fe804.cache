I want to take the analysis a step further and ask just one question about all of these shiny new improvements: How useful are they?<\/p><p class=\"\">The word \"useful\" means different things to different people. To me, something is useful if it does one or more of the following:<\/p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Serves an important purpose in a more efficient manner than another tool.<\/span><br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Saves me time, money, or effort.<\/span><br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Increases my overall level of happiness or satisfaction.<\/span><br><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"\">So with this in mind, I'd like to evaluate the new hardware and software features. I will try to keep my analysis as unbiased and objective as possible. I'll evaluate on a 0-5 scale, with 0 being \"Useless\" and 5 being \"This Could Be Life Changing\".<\/p><h3>The New 5s Hardware<\/h3><ul><li><b>New Colors - 0 <\/b><\/li><li><b>Better Camera - 1<\/b> - If your life\/business revolves around taking pictures, you probably own a DSLR or high quality camera. For casual phone photos, the old camera works just fine. One could argue that the \"better\" photos from the true tone flash would make you happier.<\/li><li><b>Fingerprint Sensor - 1<\/b> - It'll save you the hassle of remembering passwords to unlock your phone and make purchases in the iTunes store, but a fingerprint is only useful as a method of identification, making the application of this hardware pretty limited. I see a worst-case scenario unfolding where the NSA starts a fingerprint database off data from the Apple servers (I write this while adjusting my tin foil hat). <b>Update:<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccc.de\/en\/updates\/2013\/ccc-breaks-apple-touchid\" target=\"_blank\">It has already been broken<\/a>.<\/li><li><b>A7 chip - 3<\/b> - An inevitable step in the CPU arms race. The 64-bit architecture will be able to support more RAM and complex applications bringing us closer to bridging the gap between smartphone and PC, but it really isn't particularly useful at the moment with the overwhelming majority of software designed for a 32-bit CPU. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/7335\/the-iphone-5s-review\/4\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a very good analysis<\/a> of the switch from 32 to 64-bit architecture. The GPU and CPU are apparently 2x faster than the A6 though which is always a good thing, warranting a 3.<\/li><li><b>M7 Coprocessor - 1<\/b> - Saves you some battery life by working in tandem with the new A7 chip.<\/li><\/ul><p class=\"\"><i>Total score: 6 out of 20.<\/i><\/p><h3>The New iOS7 Software<\/h3><ul><li><b>Flat Design - 0<\/b> - Regardless of whether or not you like the redesign from an aesthetic standpoint, it doesn't increase the utility of the phone, no matter how much Apple would like to claim that it will help you pick the phone up \"for the first time and already know how to do the things you want to do\". Many users complain of <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ittybittyapps.com\/blog\/2013\/09\/20\/lifting-the-lid-on-ios-7s-uipicker\/\" target=\"_blank\">decreased usability<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/sloppyui.tumblr.com\/\">sloppy bugs<\/a>, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/tabtimes.com\/analysis\/ittech-os-ipad-ios\/2013\/09\/20\/ios-7-apple-has-tossed-30-years-progress-out-window\" target=\"_blank\">less intuitive design<\/a>. This is all subjective of course, with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/view\/519461\/apples-new-ios-7-drastic-changes-i-think-i-like\/\" target=\"_blank\">many<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2013\/09\/20\/people-are-whining-about-ios-7-because-people-always-whine-about-new-designs\/\" target=\"_blank\">articles<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-13579_3-57603890-37\/ios-7-is-winning-me-over-but..\/\" target=\"_blank\">written<\/a> in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/gadgetlab\/2013\/09\/more-is-better\/\" target=\"_blank\">favor<\/a> of the new design. <br><\/li><li><b>Control Center - 2<\/b> - A much needed access point for some common toggles: wifi, airplane mode, do not disturb, flashlight. This might save 2-3 minutes of interaction time per week (generously). It also obviates the need for third party flashlight apps, woohoo!<br><\/li><li><b>Notification Center - 2<\/b> - This is basically an aggregation of the calendar app, the weather app, Facebook birthdays, and the stocks app. An easy way to get an overview of information, that eliminates another 2-3 minutes per week.<\/li><li><b>Multitasking - 1<\/b> - Saves a couple of seconds of refresh time if you tend to check apps at the same time every day. Makes the process of closing background apps slower than it was previously.<\/li><li><b>New Camera Modes - 1<\/b>&nbsp;- As stated previously, if you really need access to filters and a better flash for work, invest in an actual camera. This is not going to come close to DSLR level photography, and you can get a free app to post-filter photos or crop them into squares.<\/li><li><b>Photos - 1<\/b> - Good for someone who has thousands of pictures on their camera and needs them grouped by date\/location so they can quickly show a friend. Saves a good amount of time in a very specific situation.<\/li><li><b>iCloud Photo Sharing Feature - 1<\/b> - Functionalities are the same as any group chat application, such as Whatsapp or Groupme, but without the ability to send messages, split bills, send voice memos, etc. Plus it only works between iPhone users. The interface looks cleaner though and it saves you upload time as it automatically pushes your \"shared stream\" to your friends. Just make sure you're using Snapchat to send those naughty selfies or your friends might be in for a surprise.<\/li><li><b>Airdrop - 1<\/b> - Saves you the minor hassle of sending a photo, pass, or contact card through email, SMS, or Dropbox. Requires a wifi connection and a partner with an iPhone 5 or newer.<\/li><li><b>Safari - N\/A<\/b> - Can't say much about it because I never used the old Safari. The new Safari keychain feature looks useful - it stores all of your passwords and credit card info, but it requires you to have a Mac running OS X Mavericks to access its full syncing functionalities. It's also not available yet.<\/li><li><b>iTunes Radio - 2<\/b> - The major advantage that iTunes radio has over Pandora is its seamless integration with the iTunes store, making purchases quicker and easier (which is really just a benefit for Apple). It also has less ads than Pandora, and the ability to choose between Hits, Variety, and Discovery for a slightly more curated experience. I still believe in the power of last.fm and 8tracks, but this is definitely a well-thought out and executed app. Saves me song-purchasing time and makes me happier through useful content curation choices.<\/li><li><b>Siri - 1<\/b> - A new, more human voice. Added search functionalities for twitter, bing, and wikipedia. A waveform reassures you that Siri is listening to you. No switching between Safari and Siri to answer questions. These are all pretty minor updates to what could be a much more useful feature.<\/li><li><b>App Store - 1<\/b> - The new app store lets you search for apps relevant to your location. This is an extremely specific feature that I can only see being used by tourists. The new Kids category of Apps could be useful for a parent or educator, but it's ultimately just another drawer in the app store designed to boost purchases of kid-targeted apps. Automatic app updates can cause a lot more harm than Apple's perceived benefit of not having \"to bother\" with updates and \"no more little red badge begging for your attention.\" What happens when your Facebook app auto-updates to the new version that's riddled with bugs and you were perfectly happy with the old one? Fortunately you can turn auto-update off in the settings. Not much utility added with this update, but a 1 for location-based app searching.<\/li><li><b>Find My iPhone - 0<\/b> - This could be a great feature if it weren't for <a href=\"http:\/\/bgr.com\/2013\/09\/19\/ios-7-security-flaw-find-my-iphone\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">the gaping security hole<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> that allows a very easy workaround for iPhone thieves.<br><\/span><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"\"><i>Total score: 13 out of 55.<\/i><\/p><h3>Summary<\/h3><p class=\"\">The iPhone 5s offers little to no improvement in utility over the iPhone 5.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">The most useful new hardware feature is the twofold improvement in speed. The rest of the hardware updates are quite useless, with the fingerprint sensor actually going a step beyond useless, adding unnecessary complexity and security issues to a system that was fine beforehand.<br><\/p><p class=\"\">iOS7 isn't much better. The aesthetic changes are a step sideways, not forward, which is neither good nor bad. It's just different. The conversation here is one of personal preference and taste, not of function. The most useful feature of iOS7 has to be the control center. The rest of the updates add little to no utility to the overall phone experience.<\/p><p class=\"\">As an iPhone and Mac user, it saddens me to see the great Apple engine of innovation grinding to a halt. Design that was once smart and intuitive has been sacrificed for trendy overhauls and gimmicky hardware. I really don't mind the transition from skeumorphic to flat - I just wish that it had been packaged with something that was actually useful. The fact that <b>I couldn't give any of the new features more than a 3<\/b>&nbsp;suggests to me that Apple is seriously struggling to come up with improvements to the iPhone. Meanwhile, they are sitting and twiddling their thumbs on top of the largest pile of cash on earth.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Or maybe I'm just really hard to please - I would blame Apple for making me &nbsp;this way by constantly improving the utility of their products by leaps and bounds.&nbsp;<\/span>Either way, I'm not buying the new iPhone 5s. The cost far outweighs the benefit.<\/p><p class=\"\">Next Up: Can Google step up and offer us something amazing with Google Now?

Snapchat Summarized<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat is an application that allows a user to take a photo, draw on it and\/or add a caption, then send it to his or her friends. The taker also gets to choose a lifespan for the image; it is displayed for anywhere from 1-10 seconds, after which it is no longer viewable by the receiver (unless the receiver takes a screenshot). The \"Snap\" is deleted from Snapchat's servers after it is opened.<\/p><p class=\"\"><b>2.

The key difference is selectivity: Facebook and Twitter uploads are pinned to your persona and judged by all of your friends, forever. This puts pressure on you to pick only the \u201cbest\u201d images and posts, or the images and posts that correspond with your curated online identity. As silly as it sounds, Facebook and twitter have become high-pressure environments. A picture without any likes is a failure and, therefore, you are a failure for wasting your friends' time and thinking that your content was funny or pleasing. It\u2019s trial by jury of your peers, each of whom wields the all-important power of the \"like\".<\/p><p class=\"\">Conversely, an image that garners a lot of attention and \u201clikes\" produces an inward feeling of social recognition and acceptance. Outwardly, you\u2019re proud to display your liked content as a badge of honor for the world to see how popular you are. Basically, Facebook and Twitter have quantified your social status, turning social interaction into a game that can be measured, and \u201cwon\". As with any well-structured game, competition, engagement, and stress ensue. There will always be losers.<\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat is not a competition. It\u2019s an outlet from the competitive nature of modern content sharing. You choose a select group of people to see your low-fi picture, and you don\u2019t feel pressured to create a masterpiece. Everyone is a winner. Everyone can have fun.<\/p><p class=\"\">- Snapchat is <b>easy<\/b> and <b>ephemeral<\/b>. <\/p><p class=\"\">Text messages and emails are also inherently selective services as you choose the recipients before the message is sent, so why not text instead? The big difference between snap and a picture SMS or email is its ephemeral nature. I had trouble understanding this difference the first time I saw my friends using the app. <\/p><blockquote><p class=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just send that picture as a text?\u201d <br><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It gets deleted so I don\u2019t have to deal with taking and storing pictures. Plus I can add doodles to my pictures. My dog looks fabulous with this green mustache.\u201d <br><\/span>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d <\/p><\/blockquote><p class=\"\">Now, hundreds of sent and received Snaps later, I think I finally understand. <\/p><p class=\"\">It\u2019s low quality so your snap doesn't have to be a masterpiece; you can do everything from taking the picture to doodling on it to sending it right within the app; the receiver doesn\u2019t feel any pressure to respond. It\u2019s just so easy.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">It\u2019s also about letting go of pictures, messages, data, and ideas in general. Your phone currently saves every picture you take and message you send, forcing you to go through and delete the things that make you uncomfortable. Snapchat is one of the first tech companies that's built around <b>letting things go - <\/b>a revolutionary idea given the ease with which your phone can track and store your information. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I wonder why every other company in the world saves its data, doing everything in its power to collect as much data as possible...<i>it couldn't have something to do with money, could it? <\/i>More on monetization to come - let's get back to what attracts users to the service.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">- Snapchat is<b> fun <\/b>(and occasionally<b> frisky<\/b>). <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Self-expression is fun and rewarding. Snapchat provides an unfiltered outlet for self-expression.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> I\u2019m not going to explore the topic of sexting because it\u2019s really just another form of the (perceived) freedom of expression Snapchat provides to its users. Naughty Snapchatters should be aware that a) it\u2019s very easy to screenshot a snap and b) the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.snapchat.com\/post\/64036804085\/who-can-view-my-snaps-and-stories\" target=\"_blank\">government can retrieve unopened snaps<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> with a warrant. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">To summarize: Snapchat is just a quicker, easier way to be creative and goofy with your friends. There\u2019s no pressure to create a picture that will be universally enjoyed on a larger social media network. Snapchat lets you be your weird, goofy self for a couple of seconds every day, and it feels pretty good. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><b>3. Who uses Snapchat?

With the exception of Snapchat captions, all of this data is already being exploited by other internet services. The location\/time\/frequency and text data can only really be useful for internal user base and engagement monitoring. Unless Snapchat develops software that can recognize the subject matter of Snaps, there isn't much potential for data exploitation here. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This is also where the ephemeral nature of the service comes back to bite Snapchat in the ass.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Text mining is much easier: see the trending section on Twitter. Captions could be monitored and exploited to suggest relevant ads. For example, say I Snap a friend with the caption \u201cHUNGRY!!!!\u201d. Snapchat reads my caption and communicates with the the official Taco Bell Snapchat account. Taco Bell sends me a Snap of a steaming burrito or a coupon to entice me to get off my phone and get into their restaurant.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I would have to be Snapchat friends with these corporations which would be a one way relationship, much like Twitter and Facebook users following and liking brands to receive discounts and news about their favorite products.

This user base is extremely specific at the moment. 80% of users are within the U.S. and the vast majority fall within the 13-23 age demographic.

The yellow icon featuring \u201cGhostface Chillah\u201d is easily recognizable and the app has its own terminology: \"Snaps\", \"Snapping\", etc. The naughty nature of the app has also garnered it much attention and a kind of endearingly unspoken *wink* *nudge* reputation among its loyal user base.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">Yet a brand without a unique and useful product is\u2026still useless. Take Kodak for example \u2013 it became one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/strategyaudit.wordpress.com\/2012\/02\/03\/the-kodak-brand-story\/\" target=\"_blank\">strongest brands in the world<\/a>&nbsp;after the invention of the Kodak line of cameras and film. Then, starting in the 80\u2019s, it failed to make a successful transition from the film to the digital era. Last year&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-16625725\" target=\"_blank\">Kodak filed for bankruptcy<\/a>.&nbsp;A strong brand can\u2019t pull a company without a useful product.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Brand adds value to an acquisition. Let's look at Yahoo\u2019s acquisition of Tumblr. Yahoo was going for horizontal integration: Tumblr\u2019s blogging platform provides a complementary service to Yahoo\u2019s news-oriented service that generates revenue from ads displayed to a totally different user base. If Yahoo can figure out a way to get the previously untapped but extremely loyal users flowing from Tumblr to Yahoo, then the acquisition might prove to be very lucrative indeed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Again, <b>the key here is user base<\/b>. Users know and trust Snapchat just as they know and trust Tumblr, so they will be more loyal and less likely to jump to another service, maintaining the strong value of the user base. They can then be funneled to a parent service that will actually generate revenue. Strong brand = loyal users = engaged user base = acquisition potential.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><i>d) Tech innovation\/patents<\/i> \u2013 <b>0\/5<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">There is nothing technologically advanced about Snapchat and it holds little to no value in terms of intellectual property.

A quote from the Vocus article: \u201cPro tip: Promote new products and let your followers on Snapchat be the first to know about it.

Everyone hates it and Snapchat knows it will drive people away from the service and build resentment towards the brand. People tolerate Facebook native advertising because they\u2019re hooked to the addictive and competitive nature of the service. That, and&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/adblockplus.org\/en\/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">they haven\u2019t heard of AdBlock<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat is not providing a unique service.

Unlike Facebook and Twitter, which are competitive and quantified (likes, followers, friend count), Snapchat is not used to curate an online persona for all to see and judge. People use the app to express themselves naturally with their friends. This is made possible by the ephemeral nature of the Snaps, which aren't saved so they can't be collected, compared, and judged.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Snapchat can be used as a funnel to bring its large (and growing) user base to another website. This is the only way the company can retain its attractive qualities and generate revenue at the same time. The unfortunate reality that Snapchat faces is that it <b>can generate revenue for another company, but not for itself<\/b>.

href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/gadgetlab\/2013\/09\/more-is-better\/\">this article<\/a> on the shortcomings of Siri in iOS7, and it got me thinking about the following:<br><\/p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">What are people coming to expect from their phones?<\/span><br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">How are these expectations being met (or not)?<\/span><br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Who is better equipped to meet these expectations? Apple or Google?<\/span><br><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"\">Apple has long been the champion of meeting (and exceeding) customer expectations. <b style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Curation<\/b><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> was the tool that Steve Jobs and his talented team used to create the iPhone empire. Users were presented a smooth, easy way to interact with a new and useful technology. Users didn't care that they were unable to customize their phones because the phone performed 99% percent of the tasks they needed and demanded. Technicalities were kept hidden away behind a curtain, allowing users to do these necessary tasks in a distraction and bug free environment: making calls, sending texts, browsing the web, taking pictures, listening to music, and using apps (also tightly controlled by Apple) were all easy and pain-free interactions with the iPhone.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">By removing anything potentially confusing or hard about using a smartphone and simplifying the most essential tasks, Apple curated the smartphone experience to the average consumer - a largely untapped market. Success followed to the tune of billions in sales.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Yes, Apple's marketing department also did a brilliant job of creating demand for the iPhone, but it is simply wrong to write off the iPhone as a marketing gimmick, purchased only by Apple fanboys and consumer sheep. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I once had a marketing professor who taught us about meeting customer expectations: <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>\"Always underpromise and overdeliver. Marketing is a tool that will get your product into the hands of the consumers, but it can't change their feelings about it once they actually use it. If you promise too much and underdeliver, your customers will be disappointed and frustrated. They will angrily reject your product because you have broken their trust. They will probably never buy another product from you again, and they will go out of their way to warn other consumers about their negative experience. Underpromise and overdeliver and you'll have a WOW situation: one where the customer is simply ecstatic with their purchase. It's the WOW situation you're after. This turns consumers into loyal customers who will appreciate your honesty and enjoy their experience with your brand.\"<\/i><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Apple used great marketing to get the iPhone into the hands of consumers, but it was the <b>curation of the experience<\/b> that created the WOW situation for their happy customers. Take for example the first gen iPhone ads: They promised a seamless browsing experience that would give you the essentials: music, videos, email, photos, maps, and the internet.<\/span><\/p><br>\n\n<figure class=\"k-content-embed\"><div class=\"k-content\"><iframe style=\"display:none\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1080\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0lfmlKYZ-vU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/figure>\n<br>\nThen they delivered on their promises. And then a curious thing happened: you found out that you could write yourself notes, effortlessly sync your phone with your computer, monitor the stock market, get weather updates, yelp for food, fatface your friends, and most importantly, play Fruit Ninja. You wondered how they could forget to include these amazing services on their commercials, chuckling to yourself as you posted another embarrassing photo of your friends to Facebook. The fact is that they didn't forget to tell you anything. They left it up to you to discover the beautiful world of applications. Meanwhile, the phone did exactly what you had come to expect from the brilliant, minimal ad campaign. These were the ingredients of the WOW situation.<div><br><div><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The numbers don't lie: Apple's status as the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/13\/08\/01\/apple-inc-retakes-title-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-following-strong-july\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">most valuable company in the world<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> is due largely in part to iPhone revenue which, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">as of Q2 2013, still bring in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/betanews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Apple-fiscal-Q2-2013-chart.png\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">~50% of Apple's total revenue<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. No amount of marketing panache could create a facade large enough to cover up a bad product year after year, let alone create such an explosive and continual growth in sales. It's simply ridiculous to propose that Apple has become the world's most valuable company off of ignorance and the need for conformity. The Android fanboys can beat their chests and howl all they want; it doesn't change the fact that <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">the iPhone is an extremely solid device. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">But now I'm beginning to see a problem for Apple and the iPhone. Sure, sales were great last weekend with Apple moving a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2013\/sep\/23\/iphone-5s-5c-apple-record-nine-million\" target=\"_blank\">record 9 million new units<\/a>, but I really don't see the kind of innovation behind the 5s that would warrant record-breaking growth.<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> For a complete qualification of this statement, check out my article on why the 5s is <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/roymurdock.com\/essays\/2013\/09\/how-useful-is-the-new-iphone\/\" target=\"_blank\">not particularly useful<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. Another symptom of the iPhone's frailty is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8eSrdgTHhK0\" target=\"_blank\">processing power wall<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;that Apple seems to have recently run up against (thank you Jay). The 5s is undoubtedly much more powerful than the 1st gen iPhones, but the difference is&nbsp;<\/span>minuscule<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;when compared to the 5.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The underlying problem here is that the iPhone has no more room for \"useful\". Software-wise, Apple can only fuss about with the superficial aspects of the phone: the color&nbsp;<\/span>palette<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">, the design scheme, the user interface. The new hardware it introduced is gimmicky at best, and does not support any potential for future innovation.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Google has virtually <i>unlimited<\/i> room for \"useful\". Why? Google has data. A lot of it. More data means smarter applications. Let's take a look at Google Now and Siri to see which one does a better job of curation.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=PAs6yQUCkno#t=107\" target=\"_blank\">Here's a great intro video to Google Now<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. It can pull up movie times when you're near a movie theater, a public transit schedule when you're near a train or bus station, your flight records when it comes close to departure time, interesting stock movements based on your portfolio, the number of miles you've walked and biked in the past month, etc. It gives you the information you need without even necessitating an interaction with your phone. This is referred to as <b>predictive technology<\/b>. Google Now is smart enough to know what you want before you even have to ask for it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Right off the bat, Siri requires more work because it is a <b>responsive technology<\/b>. You need to give Siri a prompt to get the information you want from it. Functionality-wise, Siri (and all of iOS7 for that matter) can only perform half of the Google Now functions using twice the amount of effort and time, using decentralized apps that aren't nearly as smart and responsive as the clusters of information given to you by Google Now. Siri + Fandango + Yelp + Facebook + Passbook + Nike Tracker + <b>Big Data<\/b> = Google Now. So how can Apple get the <b>Big Data<\/b> to make this equation balance out?<\/p><p class=\"\">Short answer: It can't.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Apple doesn't have the framework in place to know you as well as Google does. Everybody uses some combination of these apps daily: Google search, Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Maps. Don't know how to cook that chicken curry you've been craving? Google it, then watch a Youtube video. Don't know the best way to get to that concert tonight? Google Maps it, then print out those tickets you've saved in Gmail. If I was able to look at all of the searches you've executed, places you've visited, videos you've watched, and emails you've sent, I would have a pretty good picture of you as a person. This is the view that Google gets into your life. Google Now is their attempt to build you a friend\/personal assistant who has access to all of this information.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Apple does not collect data from the most powerful internet search service in the world. Apple Maps doesn't come close to the accuracy and reliability of Google Maps. Apple does not have access to your email. Apple really can't do much other than blur out your wallpaper when you pull up your notifications bar, make you a playlist in iTunes, and recommend your next app purchase. Its attempt at the next generation of content curation and predictive technology falls flat with Siri. She's a great conversationalist, but she just can't seem to remember who you are.<\/p><p class=\"\">I guess this is a good place to point out that I own a Macbook and an iPhone, and that I am not just another Android\/Google fanboy. At the moment, I am not willing to give up the beautiful, intuitive, smooth user experience and syncing abilities that the Apple experience provides. I owned an HTC Rezound for a year - the ability to customize my phone was nice, but it didn't come close to making up for the frustration caused by the incessant crashing and overall bugginess of the OS and poorly-integrated applications.<\/p><p class=\"\">Herein lies the tradeoff - Apple is safe, simple, easy to use, and has all of the functionalities that I need. Syncing between multiple Apple devices is a breeze. <b>Google needs to give me something truly badass<\/b> in order to woo me away from my comfortable, frustration-free iOS experience. The next generation of content curation - truly predictive technology - combined with a bit more Android stability might convert me once and for all. Google Now is onto something that Apple and Siri just aren't equipped to compete with.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Maybe Apple would've been better off if they hadn't introduced Siri back with the iPhone 4s - it seems like they've hit on an ever-increasing pocket of demand that they aren't equipped to handle. Responsive technology is great, but Google Now is already combining the responsive with the predictive in a dynamic and truly useful application. I see an unlimited amount of potential buried under Google's goldmine of data. I see a dead end for Siri and the iPhone.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>","excerpt":"Apple has long been the champion of meeting (and exceeding) customer expectations.

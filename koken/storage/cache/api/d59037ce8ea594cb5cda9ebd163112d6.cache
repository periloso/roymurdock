If the model works for Bitcoin, we will have a good framework to compare virtual currencies to fiat currencies. If the model doesn't fit, we'll have to adjust our model or our approach. <\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>\u201cA traditional view of money is that it has three important functions. Namely, money is a medium of exchange, it is a store of value, and it is a unit of account.\u201d - Macroeconomics, Stephen D. Williamson (457) <\/i><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This definition of money will serve as a framework for our analysis. If the substance we are considering, be it cash or bitcoin, fulfills these three functions, then we can be certain that we are looking at money.&nbsp;\n<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Now we need a way to differentiate between the different forms of money. What separates \u201cgood\u201d money from \u201cbad\u201d money?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">There is no singular, authoritative list of the necessary properties of money, but there are some generally accepted \u201cideal\u201d properties that determine how well different substances can perform the functions of money.\n\nI started with the six&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/education_resources\/economic-lowdown-podcast-series\/functions-of-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. After a bit of research, I decided to add security to the list.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">These are the properties I examined:&nbsp;<br><\/span>1. Portability <br>2. Durability <br>3. Divisibility <br>4. Fungibility (Uniformity) <br>5. Scarcity (Limited Supply) <br>6. Acceptability <br>7. Security (No counterfeits\/theft)&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">So far so good. We\u2019ve identified the major functions of money and the properties that allow a substance to fulfill those functions.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">The next task is to group the properties by the functions they fulfill.\n\nIf we see that a form of money does not score high in one property, we can draw conclusions about which function of money is violated. For example, a barrel of oil scores low on the portability scale, so we can conclude that it will not function well as a medium of exchange. Portability has no bearing on the store of value or unit of account functions of money.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">Some properties facilitate multiple functions of money. For example: Acceptability is important when considering money\u2019s function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Here is the matrix I ended up with:&nbsp;<\/p><figure class=\"k-content-embed\">\n\t<koken:load source=\"content\" filter:custom=\"matrix.png\">\n\t\t<div class=\"k-content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<koken:img \/>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t<\/koken:load>\n<\/figure><p class=\"\">Now that we have a matrix in place, let's begin our analysis in earnest by comparing the properties of the American Dollar and the bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">1.

Millions can be \"stored\" and transported on a scrap of paper. Any medium that can record 52 digits can be used to transport Bitcoin.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 2;\">Moreover, there is no point in porting a bitcoin from one place to another.

Petroleum and gold markets use the dollar as the standard unit of currency. In addition, sovereign countries such as Ecuador and El Salvador have adopted the American Dollar as their exclusive official currency for stability and credibility reasons.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This is one of the dimensions in which the dollar shines. It is also the only property that is exogenously determined.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Divisibility, Fungibility, Durability \u2013 these are all intrinsic properties of the material that we are studying.

Scarcity (SV)\nMoney has a fixed, finite supply.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">USD: The USD is as scarce as the Federal Reserve wants it to be. The Federal Reserve can print money to increase the monetary base, making more cash available in the economy and driving down nominal interest rates. Given the Fed\u2019s understanding of economics, it\u2019s safe to say that we won\u2019t see hyperinflation anytime soon, but the scarcity of the USD is determined exogenously.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">bitcoin: For now, the amount of bitcoin in the world has been capped at 21 million.

Theoretically, the&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/development\" target=\"_blank\">core developers and maintainers<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;of the system have the power to make changes to the maximum amount of BTC, or to inject bitcoin into the system.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">In order for these changes to take effect, the miners and the users running the previous version of the Bitcoin node client would&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/1qd0or\/how_much_power_do_the_bitcoin_developers_really\/\" target=\"_blank\">have to accept these changes by updating their software<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp; which would then begin to validate transactions under the new system implemented by the developers.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The Bitcoin Wiki lists a change in the hard cap as fundamental violation of the economic ideas behind Bitcoin, and that the newly altered currency&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Prohibited_changes\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn't be recognized as \"Bitcoin\"<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp; Yet it is important to note that such a change is possible - Dogecoin took the revolutionary step of&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/dogecoin\/dogecoin\/issues\/23\" target=\"_blank\">leaving the currency uncapped<\/a>, as<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;the developers decided that an inflationary currency would be beneficial in the long run.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Digital currency developers are quite similar to the Fed B.O.G. in that a small group of \"overseers\" have control over the economic policy of the governed system. One important difference is that the developers can implement changes with speed and accuracy by tweaking the algorithms behind the currency, whereas the monetary policy implemented by the Fed can take a lot longer to have an effect on the economy:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\"It can take a fairly long time for a monetary policy action to affect the economy and inflation.

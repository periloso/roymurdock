Namely, money is a medium of exchange, it is a store of value, and it is a unit of account.\u201d - Macroeconomics, Stephen D. Williamson (457)<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This definition of money will serve as a framework for our analysis. If the substance we are considering, be it cash or bitcoin, fulfills these three functions, then we can be certain that we are looking at money. \n<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Now we need a way to differentiate between the different forms of money. What separates \u201cgood\u201d money from \u201cbad\u201d money? <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">There is no singular, authoritative list of the necessary properties of money, but there are some generally accepted \u201cideal\u201d properties that determine how well different substances can perform the functions of money.\n\nI started with the six <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/education_resources\/economic-lowdown-podcast-series\/functions-of-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.

We\u2019ve identified the major functions of money and the properties that allow a substance to fulfill those functions. <\/p><p class=\"\">The next task is to group the properties by the functions they fulfill.\n\nIf we see that a form of money does not score high in one property, we can draw conclusions about which function of money is violated. For example, a barrel of oil scores low on the portability scale, so we can conclude that it will not function well as a medium of exchange. Portability has no bearing on the store of value or unit of account functions of money. <\/p><p class=\"\">Some properties facilitate multiple functions of money. For example: Acceptability is important when considering money\u2019s function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.

Why have investors put such a high price tag on what seems to be a silly messaging app with no source of revenue?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">I want to know why Snapchat is worth $4bn in the eyes of an investor. In order to evaluate where this forecasted value is coming from I will do the following:<\/p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Give a brief overview of the service. <b>What<\/b> is it?<\/span><br><\/li><li>Understand why people use Snapchat by contrasting it with similar media sharing platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Picture SMS, Email. <b>Why<\/b> do people use it?<br><\/li><li>Look at any available statistics on usage to determine user demographics and engagement. <b>Who<\/b> is using it and <b>how much<\/b> are they using it?<br><\/li><li>Compile and rate Snapchat's assets to figure out what is contributing value to the company. <b>What <\/b>gives Snapchat it's $4bn price tag?<\/li><li>Look at the different strategies Snapchat might use to extract money from its users. <b>How<\/b> are they going to monetize their service? Is monetization even possible?<br><\/li><\/ol><p class=\"\"><b>1. Snapchat Summarized<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat is an application that allows a user to take a photo, draw on it and\/or add a caption, then send it to his or her friends. The taker also gets to choose a lifespan for the image; it is displayed for anywhere from 1-10 seconds, after which it is no longer viewable by the receiver (unless the receiver takes a screenshot). The \"Snap\" is deleted from Snapchat's servers after it is opened.<\/p><p class=\"\"><b>2. Why do people use Snapchat? <\/b><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">- Snapchat is<\/span><b style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> low-pressure<\/b><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Let\u2019s start by comparing Snapchat to other social networks. The key difference is selectivity: Facebook and Twitter uploads are pinned to your persona and judged by all of your friends, forever. This puts pressure on you to pick only the \u201cbest\u201d images and posts, or the images and posts that correspond with your curated online identity. As silly as it sounds, Facebook and twitter have become high-pressure environments. A picture without any likes is a failure and, therefore, you are a failure for wasting your friends' time and thinking that your content was funny or pleasing. It\u2019s trial by jury of your peers, each of whom wields the all-important power of the \"like\".<\/p><p class=\"\">Conversely, an image that garners a lot of attention and \u201clikes\" produces an inward feeling of social recognition and acceptance. Outwardly, you\u2019re proud to display your liked content as a badge of honor for the world to see how popular you are. Basically, Facebook and Twitter have quantified your social status, turning social interaction into a game that can be measured, and \u201cwon\". As with any well-structured game, competition, engagement, and stress ensue. There will always be losers.<\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat is not a competition. It\u2019s an outlet from the competitive nature of modern content sharing. You choose a select group of people to see your low-fi picture, and you don\u2019t feel pressured to create a masterpiece. Everyone is a winner. Everyone can have fun.<\/p><p class=\"\">- Snapchat is <b>easy<\/b> and <b>ephemeral<\/b>. <\/p><p class=\"\">Text messages and emails are also inherently selective services as you choose the recipients before the message is sent, so why not text instead? The big difference between snap and a picture SMS or email is its ephemeral nature. I had trouble understanding this difference the first time I saw my friends using the app. <\/p><blockquote><p class=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just send that picture as a text?\u201d <br><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It gets deleted so I don\u2019t have to deal with taking and storing pictures. Plus I can add doodles to my pictures. My dog looks fabulous with this green mustache.\u201d <br><\/span>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d <\/p><\/blockquote><p class=\"\">Now, hundreds of sent and received Snaps later, I think I finally understand. <\/p><p class=\"\">It\u2019s low quality so your snap doesn't have to be a masterpiece; you can do everything from taking the picture to doodling on it to sending it right within the app; the receiver doesn\u2019t feel any pressure to respond. It\u2019s just so easy.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">It\u2019s also about letting go of pictures, messages, data, and ideas in general. Your phone currently saves every picture you take and message you send, forcing you to go through and delete the things that make you uncomfortable. Snapchat is one of the first tech companies that's built around <b>letting things go - <\/b>a revolutionary idea given the ease with which your phone can track and store your information. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I wonder why every other company in the world saves its data, doing everything in its power to collect as much data as possible...<i>it couldn't have something to do with money, could it? <\/i>More on monetization to come - let's get back to what attracts users to the service.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">- Snapchat is<b> fun <\/b>(and occasionally<b> frisky<\/b>). <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Self-expression is fun and rewarding. Snapchat provides an unfiltered outlet for self-expression.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> I\u2019m not going to explore the topic of sexting because it\u2019s really just another form of the (perceived) freedom of expression Snapchat provides to its users. Naughty Snapchatters should be aware that a) it\u2019s very easy to screenshot a snap and b) the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.snapchat.com\/post\/64036804085\/who-can-view-my-snaps-and-stories\" target=\"_blank\">government can retrieve unopened snaps<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> with a warrant. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">To summarize: Snapchat is just a quicker, easier way to be creative and goofy with your friends. There\u2019s no pressure to create a picture that will be universally enjoyed on a larger social media network. Snapchat lets you be your weird, goofy self for a couple of seconds every day, and it feels pretty good. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><b>3. Who uses Snapchat? How much do they use it?<\/b> <\/p><p class=\"\">It\u2019s hard to find data on Snapchat users, but here are some stats I was able to dig up from interviews with Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel: <br><\/p><ul><li>Main demographic is 13-23 year olds <br><\/li><li>80% of users are located in the US <br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">350m snaps sent a day (compare this to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/press\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">55m on Instagram<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/05\/29\/snapchat-accounts-for-more-photo-shares-than-instagram-as-pic-sharing-set-to-double-in-2013\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">400m photos shared on Facebook<\/a>)<b style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><\/b><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"\"><b>4. What is driving the Value behind Snapchat?<\/b><br><\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat's assets are primarily intangible. They include the following:<br><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>a)<\/i> Data<br><\/span><i>b)<\/i> User Base<br><i>c)<\/i> Brand<br><i>d)<\/i> Patents\/Tech Processes<br><i>e)<\/i> Threat to Established Companies <\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I\u2019ll rate these sources of value as objectively as possible on a scale from 0-5 so we can get a better sense of the actual value behind the company. <\/span><\/p><div><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>a) Data<\/i> \u2013 <b>1\/5<\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Data is the currency of the digital economy.

When you send or receive Snaps, we also temporarily collect, process and store the contents of the Snaps (such as photos, videos and\/or captions) on our servers.\u201d - <\/i><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.snapchat.com\/privacy\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Snapchat Privacy Policy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">All that Snapchat gets in the way of useful data is your email address, phone number, age, location\/time\/frequency of Snaps, and any text you include with your message. With the exception of Snapchat captions, all of this data is already being exploited by other internet services. The location\/time\/frequency and text data can only really be useful for internal user base and engagement monitoring. Unless Snapchat develops software that can recognize the subject matter of Snaps, there isn't much potential for data exploitation here. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This is also where the ephemeral nature of the service comes back to bite Snapchat in the ass.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Text mining is much easier: see the trending section on Twitter. Captions could be monitored and exploited to suggest relevant ads. For example, say I Snap a friend with the caption \u201cHUNGRY!!!!\u201d. Snapchat reads my caption and communicates with the the official Taco Bell Snapchat account. Taco Bell sends me a Snap of a steaming burrito or a coupon to entice me to get off my phone and get into their restaurant.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I would have to be Snapchat friends with these corporations which would be a one way relationship, much like Twitter and Facebook users following and liking brands to receive discounts and news about their favorite products. This monetization scheme also assumes that the caption is referring to me and not the hungry cat I might be taking a picture of.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>b) User Base<\/i> \u2013 <b>4\/5<\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Snapchat enjoys a first to move position in the market and with 350m Snaps a day, it clearly has a healthy (yet undisclosed) user base. This user base is extremely specific at the moment. 80% of users are within the U.S. and the vast majority fall within the 13-23 age demographic. This leaves an awful lot of room for growth both regionally and demographically. There are millions of untapped phones out there in Europe, India, China, and (soon to be) <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/140467\/why-apples-first-retail-store-in-brazil-is-actually-a-really-big-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">South America<\/a> - this is a massive horizontal growth opportunity<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">There are millions of untapped phones in the U.S. owned and operated by the 23-50 age demographic - this is a massive vertical growth opportunity.

The yellow icon featuring \u201cGhostface Chillah\u201d is easily recognizable and the app has its own terminology: \"Snaps\", \"Snapping\", etc. The naughty nature of the app has also garnered it much attention and a kind of endearingly unspoken *wink* *nudge* reputation among its loyal user base.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">Yet a brand without a unique and useful product is\u2026still useless. Take Kodak for example \u2013 it became one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/strategyaudit.wordpress.com\/2012\/02\/03\/the-kodak-brand-story\/\" target=\"_blank\">strongest brands in the world<\/a>&nbsp;after the invention of the Kodak line of cameras and film. Then, starting in the 80\u2019s, it failed to make a successful transition from the film to the digital era. Last year&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-16625725\" target=\"_blank\">Kodak filed for bankruptcy<\/a>.&nbsp;A strong brand can\u2019t pull a company without a useful product.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Brand adds value to an acquisition. Let's look at Yahoo\u2019s acquisition of Tumblr. Yahoo was going for horizontal integration: Tumblr\u2019s blogging platform provides a complementary service to Yahoo\u2019s news-oriented service that generates revenue from ads displayed to a totally different user base. If Yahoo can figure out a way to get the previously untapped but extremely loyal users flowing from Tumblr to Yahoo, then the acquisition might prove to be very lucrative indeed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Again, <b>the key here is user base<\/b>. Users know and trust Snapchat just as they know and trust Tumblr, so they will be more loyal and less likely to jump to another service, maintaining the strong value of the user base. They can then be funneled to a parent service that will actually generate revenue. Strong brand = loyal users = engaged user base = acquisition potential.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><i>d) Tech innovation\/patents<\/i> \u2013 <b>0\/5<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">There is nothing technologically advanced about Snapchat and it holds little to no value in terms of intellectual property. This rules out acquisition for vertical integration \u2013 when one company absorbs another for the technology and patents of the smaller company. E.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/news\/articles\/SB10001424053111903392904576509953821437960\" target=\"_blank\">Google buys Motorola<\/a>&nbsp;for its hardware patents and smartphone technology.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>e) Competition<\/i>&nbsp;<\/span>\u2013<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><b>0\/5<\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Large companies want to protect their market share.

Spiegel's delusions of grandeur regarding the \"different direction\" Snapchat is headed in smell of an inflated ego and rotten revenue streams - which brings us to our next and arguably most pertinent question: How is Snapchat going to make any money?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\" <=\"\" p=\"\"><b>MONETIZATION STRATEGIES<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">I will concede that Snapchat has an amazing amount of potential in terms of gathering a large user base.

A quote from the Vocus article: \u201cPro tip: Promote new products and let your followers on Snapchat be the first to know about it. Add text to personalize each snap.\u201d How is this Vocus website still in existence? Yes, this is how you use the application.

Everyone hates it and Snapchat knows it will drive people away from the service and build resentment towards the brand. People tolerate Facebook native advertising because they\u2019re hooked to the addictive and competitive nature of the service. That, and&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/adblockplus.org\/en\/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">they haven\u2019t heard of AdBlock<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Snapchat is not providing a unique service. The moment they start to annoy their users with subscriptions or obtrusive ads, users can easily switch to another service or simply stop using Snapchat. They'll avoid annoying their users at all costs.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><b>2) Content Discovery<\/b><\/span><\/p><blockquote><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cOur team is really interested in supporting people who don\u2019t have a marketing team and a big voice.

Tencent has&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tencent.com\/zh-cn\/content\/ir\/fs\/attachments\/ProductlistofTencent.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">over 800 million active monthly users<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. That's almost 3x the population of the good old US of A.&nbsp;<\/span><b>Competition<\/b> to see who can get the best gear for their characters or the coolest clothing for their avatars drives purchases among these hundreds of millions of users.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">This element of <b>competition<\/b> would destroy the fun, easygoing nature of Snapchat; the fundamental element of the service that makes it so attractive in the first place.<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"k-content-embed\">\n\t<koken:array_access index=\"2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"k-content\">\n\t\t\t<koken:link lightbox=\"true\">\n\t\t\t<koken:img \/>\n\t\t\t<\/koken:link>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"k-content-text\"><span class=\"k-content-title\">{{ content.title | content.filename }}<\/span><span class=\"k-content-caption\">{{ content.caption }}<\/span><\/figcaption>\n\t<\/koken:array_access>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p class=\"\"><br>Other in-app purchases that might generate negligible streams of revenue would be stickers \u00e0&nbsp;la Facebook or Snap limits, where users would be charged to send more than say, 100 Snaps a day.

Unlike Facebook and Twitter, which are competitive and quantified (likes, followers, friend count), Snapchat is not used to curate an online persona for all to see and judge. People use the app to express themselves naturally with their friends. This is made possible by the ephemeral nature of the Snaps, which aren't saved so they can't be collected, compared, and judged.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Snapchat can be used as a funnel to bring its large (and growing) user base to another website. This is the only way the company can retain its attractive qualities and generate revenue at the same time. The unfortunate reality that Snapchat faces is that it <b>can generate revenue for another company, but not for itself<\/b>. This is the first selfless service I've ever seen valued at 4 billion dollars.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">If we return to the graph at the beginning of the article we see that the value of Youtube is $1.5bn - this is the price Google bought it at in 2006. It's now estimated to be worth anywhere from&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.musicweek.com\/news\/read\/youtube-value-estimated-between-15-6-billion-and-21-3-billion\/055563\" target=\"_blank\">$15<\/a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.valuewalk.com\/2012\/03\/google-inc-goog-youtube\/\" target=\"_blank\">$45bn<\/a>. This is the power of combining a great funneling service with an ad giant like Google. This is Snapchat's only hope of creating value for its board and investors, and <b>it can only be realized by another company<\/b>.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">Facebook is already seeing the benefits of its Instagram acquisition, and with the the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/pandodaily.com\/2013\/11\/01\/surprise-instagram-users-hate-the-new-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\">introduction of native ads on Instagram<\/a>&nbsp;we can be will most definitely be seeing profit growth in Facebook's future. Following its disastrous IPO, shares of Facebook have gained 250% from a low of ~$20 to a recent high of ~$54 due to a strong mobile push aided by, you guessed it, Instagram. Worth the $1bn acquisition? I think so.<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"k-content-embed\">\n\t<koken:array_access index=\"4\">\n\t\t<div class=\"k-content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<koken:img \/>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"k-content-text\"><span class=\"k-content-caption\">{{ content.caption }}<\/span><\/figcaption>\n\t<\/koken:array_access>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Spiegel, you nailed it when you said that Tencent makes money by building \"things that people want\". You\u2019ve developed an application that people want, and if you try to change it through any type of monetization scheme you\u2019ll end up with an application that people don\u2019t want. You\u2019ve got no data, no infrastructure, no patents, no cutting-edge tech, no wiggle-room for monetization, and yet you\u2019re still looking down your nose at acquisition?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">No, you're smarter than that. I think you and your team are playing a dangerous game. As long as the investor money keeps coming in, you'll let the good times roll! You've bought yourself another year or so before acquisition, and every round of funding fluffs up the value of the company for the inevitable buyout.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">But what happens when you realize that most of your user base is already on Facebook and Twitter, and that the extra traffic from your service is not worth $4bn to advertisers who are toying with a dangerously-close-to-broken revenue model? The bubble bursts, and you're left paying the server bills and the wages of the&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.quora.com\/Snapchat\/How-many-employees-does-Snapchat-have\" target=\"_blank\">21 employees<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;that will never see any monetary returns on their work.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. $4bn for an easily replaceable service that is little more than Microsoft Paint duct taped to a disposable camera? A service that voluntarily throws away its own data in the golden age of data hoarding? A service devoid of the nature of competition that is the driving force behind every other profitable company in the world? A service that is intrinsically worthless? Please Snapchat, or anybody for that matter, prove me wrong and restore my faith in investors and humanity in general.<\/p><\/div>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=6671371\" target=\"_blank\">Further Discussion on Hacker News<\/a><br><\/p><\/koken:load>","excerpt":"While Snapchat's valuation is nowhere close to that of Apple and Facebook, it is surprisingly close to stable, established companies with actual revenue streams.

Digital currency has a long way to go in securing the social clout needed to power the exogenously-determined properties of money: acceptability and security.<\/p><p class=\"\">The comparative analysis led me to discover two things above all:<\/p><p class=\"\">1) Virtual currency is a lot more efficient than physical currency. If\/When it is implemented and controlled by correctly, it has the potential to cut costs and achieve economic goals in a faster and more accurate manner than our current scheme: Central Bank conducting open market operations and setting reserve requirements and interest rates.<br><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">2) Our concept of \"money\" and its functions is continually evolving alongside our society. Our society has evolved quite rapidly in the past couple of decades alongside technology and globalization. A reevaluation of our definition of \"money\" is inevitable.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">If you are interested in following the analysis that led me to these conclusions, please read on. I will examine our current political and societal state in regards to virtual currency in my next post.<\/p><p class=\"\"><i style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\u201cA traditional view of money is that it has three important functions. Namely, money is a medium of exchange, it is a store of value, and it is a unit of account.\u201d - Macroeconomics, Stephen D. Williamson (457)<\/i><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This definition of money will serve as a framework for our analysis. If the substance we are considering, be it cash or bitcoin, fulfills these three functions, then we can be certain that we are looking at money. \n<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Now we need a way to differentiate between the different forms of money. What separates \u201cgood\u201d money from \u201cbad\u201d money? <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">There is no singular, authoritative list of the necessary properties of money, but there are some generally accepted \u201cideal\u201d properties that determine how well different substances can perform the functions of money.\n\nI started with the six <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/education_resources\/economic-lowdown-podcast-series\/functions-of-money\/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. After a bit of research, I decided to add security to the list. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">These are the properties I examined: <br><\/span>1. Portability <br>2. Durability <br>3. Divisibility <br>4. Fungibility (Uniformity) <br>5. Scarcity (Limited Supply) <br>6. Acceptability <br>7. Security (No counterfeits\/theft)&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">So far so good. We\u2019ve identified the major functions of money and the properties that allow a substance to fulfill those functions.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">The next task is to group the properties by the functions they fulfill.\n\nIf we see that a form of money does not score high in one property, we can draw conclusions about which function of money is violated. For example, a barrel of oil scores low on the portability scale, so we can conclude that it will not function well as a medium of exchange. Portability has no bearing on the store of value or unit of account functions of money.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\">Some properties facilitate multiple functions of money. For example: Acceptability is important when considering money\u2019s function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Here is the matrix I ended up with:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"k-content-embed\">\n\t<koken:load source=\"content\" filter:custom=\"matrix.png\">\n\t\t<div class=\"k-content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<koken:img \/>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n\t<\/koken:load>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p class=\"\">Now that we have a matrix in place, let's begin our analysis in earnest by comparing the properties of the American Dollar and the bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">1. Portablility (ME)\nMoney must be easy to transport.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rai_stones\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 2;\">Rai Stones<\/a>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">exhibit low portability.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">USD: Paper money is extremely portable. The small size and weight of a dollar bill makes it a convenient means of transaction.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">bitcoin: A bitcoin exists as data on server, 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s expressed by thousands of tiny transistors - it is as portable as a flash drive or a slip of paper. Millions can be \"stored\" and transported on a scrap of paper. Any medium that can record 52 digits can be used to transport Bitcoin. Moreover, there is no point in porting a bitcoin from one place to another. It exists on a server, and you mine it, access it, and spend it remotely.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>Portability is not a relevant property when we consider Bitcoin.<\/i><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">2. Fungibility (ME)\nThe property of mutual substitution.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Artwork and houses exhibit low fungibility.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">USD: The USD is pretty good when it comes to fungibility, as all denominations are worth exactly the same amount. There are minor cosmetic differences and systems in place for identification, but these would rarely stop us from swapping $20 bills. As the bills begin to deteriorate, their fungibility is called into questions.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">bitcoin: bitcoins and satoshis are almost perfect fungibility wise.

Divisibility (ME)\nIt must be easily divisible into different denominations.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Artwork, cars, and machinery exhibit low divisibility.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">USD: A paper dollar cannot be halved and exchanged as two units of 50 cents. Carrying change is a minor annoyance.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">bitcoin: bitcoins can be instantly divided down to 8 decimal places, saving a trip to the bank and allowing for much greater flexibility than dollars and pennies.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>bitcoins are much more divisible than USD.&nbsp;<\/i><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;4.

Petroleum and gold markets use the dollar as the standard unit of currency. In addition, sovereign countries such as Ecuador and El Salvador have adopted the American Dollar as their exclusive official currency for stability and credibility reasons.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">This is one of the dimensions in which the dollar shines. It is also the only property that is exogenously determined.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Divisibility, Fungibility, Durability \u2013 these are all intrinsic properties of the material that we are studying. Acceptability is the bridging characteristic between money and man. It reflects our society\u2019s ability to understand and cope with change.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">bitcoin: At this moment, approximately 3,000 merchants accept Bitcoin worldwide.

Scarcity (SV)\nMoney has a fixed, finite supply.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">USD: The USD is as scarce as the Federal Reserve wants it to be. The Federal Reserve can print money to increase the monetary base, making more cash available in the economy and driving down nominal interest rates. Given the Fed\u2019s understanding of economics, it\u2019s safe to say that we won\u2019t see hyperinflation anytime soon, but the scarcity of the USD is determined exogenously.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">bitcoin: For now, the amount of bitcoin in the world has been capped at 21 million.

Theoretically, the&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/development\" target=\"_blank\">core developers and maintainers<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;of the system have the power to make changes to the maximum amount of BTC, or to inject bitcoin into the system.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">In order for these changes to take effect, the miners and the users running the previous version of the Bitcoin node client would&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/1qd0or\/how_much_power_do_the_bitcoin_developers_really\/\" target=\"_blank\">have to accept these changes by updating their software<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp; which would then begin to validate transactions under the new system implemented by the developers.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The Bitcoin Wiki lists a change in the hard cap as fundamental violation of the economic ideas behind Bitcoin, and that the newly altered currency&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Prohibited_changes\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn't be recognized as \"Bitcoin\"<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp; Yet it is important to note that such a change is possible - Dogecoin took the revolutionary step of&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/dogecoin\/dogecoin\/issues\/23\" target=\"_blank\">leaving the currency uncapped<\/a>, as<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;the developers decided that an inflationary currency would be beneficial in the long run.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Digital currency developers are quite similar to the Fed B.O.G. in that a small group of \"overseers\" have control over the economic policy of the governed system. One important difference is that the developers can implement changes with speed and accuracy by tweaking the algorithms behind the currency, whereas the monetary policy implemented by the Fed can take a lot longer to have an effect on the economy:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><blockquote style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\"><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\"It can take a fairly long time for a monetary policy action to affect the economy and inflation.

of Siri in iOS7, and it got me thinking about the following:<\/span><br><\/div><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">What are people coming to expect from their phones?<\/span><br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">How are these expectations being met (or not)?<\/span><br><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Who is better equipped to meet these expectations? Apple or Google?<\/span><br><\/li><\/ul><p class=\"\">Apple has long been the champion of meeting (and exceeding) customer expectations. <b style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Curation<\/b><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> was the tool that Steve Jobs and his talented team used to create the iPhone empire. Users were presented a smooth, easy way to interact with a new and useful technology. Users didn't care that they were unable to customize their phones because the phone performed 99% percent of the tasks they needed and demanded. Technicalities were kept hidden away behind a curtain, allowing users to do these necessary tasks in a distraction and bug free environment: making calls, sending texts, browsing the web, taking pictures, listening to music, and using apps (also tightly controlled by Apple) were all easy and pain-free interactions with the iPhone.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">By removing anything potentially confusing or hard about using a smartphone and simplifying the most essential tasks, Apple curated the smartphone experience to the average consumer - a largely untapped market. Success followed to the tune of billions in sales.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Yes, Apple's marketing department also did a brilliant job of creating demand for the iPhone, but it is simply wrong to write off the iPhone as a marketing gimmick, purchased only by Apple fanboys and consumer sheep. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">I once had a marketing professor who taught us about meeting customer expectations: <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"><i>\"Always underpromise and overdeliver. Marketing is a tool that will get your product into the hands of the consumers, but it can't change their feelings about it once they actually use it. If you promise too much and underdeliver, your customers will be disappointed and frustrated. They will angrily reject your product because you have broken their trust. They will probably never buy another product from you again, and they will go out of their way to warn other consumers about their negative experience. Underpromise and overdeliver and you'll have a WOW situation: one where the customer is simply ecstatic with their purchase. It's the WOW situation you're after. This turns consumers into loyal customers who will appreciate your honesty and enjoy their experience with your brand.\"<\/i><\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Apple used great marketing to get the iPhone into the hands of consumers, but it was the <b>curation of the experience<\/b> that created the WOW situation for their happy customers. Take for example the first gen iPhone ads: They promised a seamless browsing experience that would give you the essentials: music, videos, email, photos, maps, and the internet.<\/span><\/p><br>\n\n<figure class=\"k-content-embed\"><div class=\"k-content\"><iframe style=\"display:none\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1080\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0lfmlKYZ-vU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/figure>\n<br>\nThen they delivered on their promises. And then a curious thing happened: you found out that you could write yourself notes, effortlessly sync your phone with your computer, monitor the stock market, get weather updates, yelp for food, fatface your friends, and most importantly, play Fruit Ninja. You wondered how they could forget to include these amazing services on their commercials, chuckling to yourself as you posted another embarrassing photo of your friends to Facebook. The fact is that they didn't forget to tell you anything. They left it up to you to discover the beautiful world of applications. Meanwhile, the phone did exactly what you had come to expect from the brilliant, minimal ad campaign. These were the ingredients of the WOW situation.<div><br><div><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The numbers don't lie: Apple's status as the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/13\/08\/01\/apple-inc-retakes-title-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-following-strong-july\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">most valuable company in the world<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> is due largely in part to iPhone revenue which, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">as of Q2 2013, still bring in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/betanews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Apple-fiscal-Q2-2013-chart.png\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">~50% of Apple's total revenue<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. No amount of marketing panache could create a facade large enough to cover up a bad product year after year, let alone create such an explosive and continual growth in sales. It's simply ridiculous to propose that Apple has become the world's most valuable company off of ignorance and the need for conformity. The Android fanboys can beat their chests and howl all they want; it doesn't change the fact that <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">the iPhone is an extremely solid device. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">But now I'm beginning to see a problem for Apple and the iPhone. Sure, sales were great last weekend with Apple moving a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2013\/sep\/23\/iphone-5s-5c-apple-record-nine-million\" target=\"_blank\">record 9 million new units<\/a>, but I really don't see the kind of innovation behind the 5s that would warrant record-breaking growth.<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> For a complete qualification of this statement, check out my article on why the 5s is <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/roymurdock.com\/essays\/2013\/09\/how-useful-is-the-new-iphone\/\" target=\"_blank\">not particularly useful<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. Another symptom of the iPhone's frailty is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8eSrdgTHhK0\" target=\"_blank\">processing power wall<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> that Apple seems to have recently run up against (thank you Jay). The 5s is undoubtedly much more powerful than the 1st gen iPhones, but the difference is <\/span>minuscule<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> when compared to the 5.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The underlying problem here is that the iPhone has no more room for \"useful\". Software-wise, Apple can only fuss about with the superficial aspects of the phone: the color <\/span>palette<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">, the design scheme, the user interface. The new hardware it introduced is gimmicky at best, and does not support any potential for future innovation.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Google has virtually <i>unlimited<\/i> room for \"useful\". Why? Google has data. A lot of it. More data means smarter applications. Let's take a look at Google Now and Siri to see which one does a better job of curation.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=PAs6yQUCkno#t=107\" target=\"_blank\">Here's a great intro video to Google Now<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. It can pull up movie times when you're near a movie theater, a public transit schedule when you're near a train or bus station, your flight records when it comes close to departure time, interesting stock movements based on your portfolio, the number of miles you've walked and biked in the past month, etc. It gives you the information you need without even necessitating an interaction with your phone. This is referred to as <b>predictive technology<\/b>. Google Now is smart enough to know what you want before you even have to ask for it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Right off the bat, Siri requires more work because it is a <b>responsive technology<\/b>. You need to give Siri a prompt to get the information you want from it. Functionality-wise, Siri (and all of iOS7 for that matter) can only perform half of the Google Now functions using twice the amount of effort and time, using decentralized apps that aren't nearly as smart and responsive as the clusters of information given to you by Google Now. Siri + Fandango + Yelp + Facebook + Passbook + Nike Tracker + <b>Big Data<\/b> = Google Now. So how can Apple get the <b>Big Data<\/b> to make this equation balance out?<\/p><p class=\"\">Short answer: It can't.&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Apple doesn't have the framework in place to know you as well as Google does. Everybody uses some combination of these apps daily: Google search, Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Maps. Don't know how to cook that chicken curry you've been craving? Google it, then watch a Youtube video. Don't know the best way to get to that concert tonight? Google Maps it, then print out those tickets you've saved in Gmail. If I was able to look at all of the searches you've executed, places you've visited, videos you've watched, and emails you've sent, I would have a pretty good picture of you as a person. This is the view that Google gets into your life. Google Now is their attempt to build you a friend\/personal assistant who has access to all of this information.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">Apple does not collect data from the most powerful internet search service in the world. Apple Maps doesn't come close to the accuracy and reliability of Google Maps. Apple does not have access to your email. Apple really can't do much other than blur out your wallpaper when you pull up your notifications bar, make you a playlist in iTunes, and recommend your next app purchase. Its attempt at the next generation of content curation and predictive technology falls flat with Siri. She's a great conversationalist, but she just can't seem to remember who you are.<\/p><p class=\"\">I guess this is a good place to point out that I own a Macbook and an iPhone, and that I am not just another Android\/Google fanboy. At the moment, I am not willing to give up the beautiful, intuitive, smooth user experience and syncing abilities that the Apple experience provides. I owned an HTC Rezound for a year - the ability to customize my phone was nice, but it didn't come close to making up for the frustration caused by the incessant crashing and overall bugginess of the OS and poorly-integrated applications.<\/p><p class=\"\">Herein lies the tradeoff - Apple is safe, simple, easy to use, and has all of the functionalities that I need. Syncing between multiple Apple devices is a breeze. <b>Google needs to give me something truly badass<\/b> in order to woo me away from my comfortable, frustration-free iOS experience. The next generation of content curation - truly predictive technology - combined with a bit more Android stability might convert me once and for all. Google Now is onto something that Apple and Siri just aren't equipped to compete with.<\/p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Maybe Apple would've been better off if they hadn't introduced Siri back with the iPhone 4s - it seems like they've hit on an ever-increasing pocket of demand that they aren't equipped to handle. Responsive technology is great, but Google Now is already combining the responsive with the predictive in a dynamic and truly useful application. I see an unlimited amount of potential buried under Google's goldmine of data. I see a dead end for Siri and the iPhone.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>","excerpt":"Apple has long been the champion of meeting (and exceeding) customer expectations.
